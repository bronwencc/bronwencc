ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @bronwencc, a data scientist working with Python and other tools of the trade.

Have a look at my projects that use various techniques and data sources; they're pinned to my profile.

I'm currently improving my knowledge of statistics, TensorFlow, SQL and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/).

I've also written [blog posts](https://bronwencc.github.io) about data science topics.
