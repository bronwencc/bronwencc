Iâ€™m a data scientist working primarily in Python.

Have a look at projects pinned to my profile that use various techniques and data sources.

I'm currently continuing to improve my knowledge of statistics, SQL and machine learning.

I've also written [blog posts](https://bronwencc.github.io) about some data science topics.
